    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\t\n",
    "6 \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- value: 'hello', -87.8, 6\n",
    "expressions: *,-,|, +, \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- A Varibale is a store of information, and String is a type of information you would store in a variable. ASring is usually words, enclosed with  \"\" Eg string x= \"Hello world\". X is the variableand we declared it as a string using the single '' or \"\". \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-\n",
    "1- Numeric Data Type- Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. these value are defined as int, float and complex class inpython.\n",
    "2- String Data Type- String data type are sequences of character data. The string type in Python is called str.\n",
    "3- boolean Data Type- boolean data is one of python's buid-in data types. it's used to represent the truth value of an expression. for example, the expression 1 <=2 is True, while the expression 0 == 1 is the False.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- An expression is a combination of value, varriable, operators, and calls to functions. Expression need to be print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and display the resuld.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Answer- An expression evaluates to a single value, A statement does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- The bacon varriable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon +1).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- Because Variable name can't begin with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Answer- The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only string can be concatenated to other string with the + operator. the correct way is i have eaten ' + str(99) + 'burritos.'.\n",
